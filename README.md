# HelloWorld
My first repository
# An insight into my world
![starcluster](star_cluster.jpg)Hi everyone.  This is the first repository that I have ever created. After writing in Fortean, Pascal and C/C++ for decades I am finally going to experience a method of decent version control.
# Hobbies
Walking in national parks, cycling and visiting interesting overseas countries.
